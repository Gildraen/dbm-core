# 🚀 Implement Clean Architecture & CI/CD Pipeline

## Overview
This PR delivers a comprehensive modernization of the Discord bot core library with Clean Architecture patterns, dependency injection, and a complete CI/CD pipeline. The refactoring improves testability, maintainability, and developer experience while maintaining backward compatibility for existing modules.

## 🏗️ Major Architecture Improvements

### Clean Architecture Implementation
- Repository Pattern - Abstracted database operations with MigrationRepository interface
- Dependency Injection - Use cases receive dependencies instead of creating them
- Interface Segregation - Clear contracts between domain and infrastructure layers
- Testability - 100% mockable dependencies for reliable unit testing

### Domain-Driven Design
```typescript
// Domain Layer - Pure business logic
interface MigrationRepository {
    getPrismaClient(): PrismaClient;
}

// Infrastructure Layer - Technical implementation
class PrismaMigrationRepository implements MigrationRepository {
    constructor(private prisma: PrismaClient) {}
}

// Application Layer - Use cases with injected dependencies
class StartMigration {
    constructor(private repository: MigrationRepository, private dryRun = false) {}
}
```

### Maintained Developer Experience
- ✅ No breaking changes - Module interface unchanged
- ✅ Simple module development - Modules still receive { prisma, dryRun }
- ✅ CLI convenience - Same commands, improved internals
- ✅ Library exports - Minimal surface area (ModuleInterface only)

## 🎯 Key Features

### Enhanced Testing Strategy
- 24/24 tests passing with improved mock strategies
- Path-agnostic tests for CI compatibility across environments
- Fast execution - No external database dependencies in tests
- Comprehensive coverage - Use cases, domain logic, and infrastructure

### Modern CI/CD Pipeline
- Node.js 22 - Updated for Vite 7.0.2 compatibility
- GitHub Package Registry - Secure publishing with @gildraen scope
- Four-stage workflow - CI → Beta → Manual Release → Stable Publishing
- Environment protection - Manual approval required for production releases

### Package Naming Strategy
- **Package Name**: `@gildraen/dbm-core` - Clear DBM (Discord Bot Modules) branding
- **Scope**: `@gildraen` - Matches GitHub username for registry compatibility
- **Future Expansion**: Ready for `@gildraen/dbm-utils`, `@gildraen/dbm-commands`, etc.
- **Professional**: Short, memorable, and developer-friendly

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### New Architecture Files
```
src/domain/interface/
├── MigrationRepository.ts     # Clean domain interface
└── ModuleInterface.ts         # Existing module contract

src/infrastructure/repository/
└── PrismaMigrationRepository.ts # Concrete Prisma implementation
```

### Refactored Core Logic
- StartMigration - Uses dependency injection pattern
- CLI tools - Properly inject repository dependencies  
- Export strategy - Minimal library surface area
- Test suite - Mock-based testing with proper isolation

### Updated CI/CD Workflows

#### 1. CI Pipeline (ci.yml)
- Node.js 22 for Vite compatibility
- Yarn frozen-lockfile for reproducible builds
- Full validation - Lint → Test → Build

#### 2. Beta Releases (beta.yml)
- Automatic from main - Timestamped beta versions
- GitHub Package Registry publishing
- Integration testing support

#### 3. Manual Releases (manual-release.yml)
- GitHub UI control - Manual release trigger
- Environment protection - Approval required
- Version management - Semantic versioning

#### 4. Stable Publishing (release.yml)
- Tag-based releases - GitHub release triggers
- Automatic publishing - Stable package distribution

## 🛡️ Quality Assurance

### Testing Improvements
- Environment-agnostic - Tests work in dev containers and GitHub Actions
- Clean mocking - Repository pattern enables proper unit testing
- No external dependencies - Fast, reliable test execution
- Regression protection - All existing functionality verified

### Code Quality
- SOLID principles - Single responsibility, dependency inversion
- Clean Code practices - No explicit default parameters
- TypeScript strict mode - Full type safety
- ESLint compliance - Consistent code standards

## 📦 Publishing Strategy

### Release Flow
```
PR → CI Tests → Merge to main → Beta Release → Manual Release Approval → Stable Package
```

### Package Usage
```bash
# Beta testing
yarn add @gildraen/dbm-core@beta

# Stable releases  
yarn add @gildraen/dbm-core@latest
```

## 🔄 Migration Path

### For Existing Modules
- ✅ No changes required - Same ModuleInterface
- ✅ Same CLI commands - Improved internals, same interface
- ✅ Backward compatible - Existing modules work unchanged

### For Advanced Users
```typescript
// New programmatic access
import { 
  type ModuleInterface,
  StartMigration, 
  PrismaMigrationRepository 
} from "@gildraen/dbm-core";

// Custom implementations possible
const repository = new PrismaMigrationRepository(customPrisma);
const migration = new StartMigration(repository, true);
```

## 🚀 Benefits Delivered
