# Project Overview

This project is a TypeScript library called **Discord Bot Core (@gildraen/dbm-core)** that provides a module management system for Discord bots using Clean Architecture principles.

## Architecture

The project follows Clean Architecture with three main layers:

- **Domain**: Core business logic and entities
- **Application**: Use cases and application services
- **Infrastructure**: External integrations (CLI, repository implementations)

## Libraries and Frameworks

- TypeScript 5.x with strict mode enabled
- Node.js 22 LTS runtime
- Vitest for testing framework
- ESLint for code linting
- GitHub Package Registry with @gildraen scope

## Package Manager Requirements

üö® **CRITICAL**: Always use `yarn` - NEVER use `npm`

- ‚úÖ **Terminal commands**: `yarn build`, `yarn test`, `yarn install`
- ‚úÖ **Documentation**: All examples must show `yarn` commands
- ‚úÖ **Scripts**: Reference `yarn` in package.json scripts
- ‚ùå **Never use**: `npm run`, `npm test`, `npm install`, etc.

This is a strict project standard that must be followed in all contexts.

## Development Principles

- Follow Clean Architecture dependency rules (Domain ‚Üê Application ‚Üê Infrastructure)
- Use dependency injection pattern
- Use path mapping: `app/*` maps to `src/*`
- Write comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Mock only external dependencies, test domain logic directly
